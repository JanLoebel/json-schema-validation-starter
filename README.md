## Usage

Include the starter into you're project.

You need to add jitpack to your `pom.xml` because this project is not available in the official maven repository.
```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Add the `json-schema-validation-starter`-dependency to your `pom.xml`
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.JanLoebel</groupId>
    <artifactId>json-schema-validation-starter</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

After that simply create a json-schema and put it into e.g.: `resources/jsonschema/book.json`.
The last step is now to let your entity know that it should be validated and which schema it should use.

```
@JsonSchemaValidation("classpath:jsonschema/book.json")
public class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
}
```
